## What is Fusion 360?  

**Fusion 360** is a comprehensive **3D design and manufacturing platform** that integrates CAD, CAM, and CAE tools into a single, cloud-connected workspace. It’s built for engineers, product designers, and makers who need precision, power, and collaboration in every stage of their creative process.  

The software combines modeling, simulation, rendering, and manufacturing into one unified environment. Whether you're designing mechanical components, prototyping consumer products, or running stress tests on assemblies, Fusion 360 provides all the tools you need to bring concepts from idea to production.  

Fusion 360 supports both **parametric** and **freeform modeling**, allowing you to design with flexibility and accuracy. It also includes **generative design** powered by AI, which explores multiple optimized solutions for engineering challenges.  

With its **cloud-based collaboration**, teams can share projects, version models, and co-edit designs in real time. Fusion 360 is also optimized for **Apple Silicon**, ensuring faster rendering, improved performance, and smoother workflows on modern hardware.  

Perfect for mechanical engineers, industrial designers, and creators — Fusion 360 bridges creativity and functionality in one streamlined platform.
